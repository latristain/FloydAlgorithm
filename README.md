### General Info

The Floyd's algorithm was developed recursively (RecursiveCode.py) through nested loops, adding user interactive characteristics, (the computer will question the user the number of vectors and the distance between them to later show the optimal solution in the terminal). Two programs were additionally developed, one to validate the expected results, and the other one to measure the performance of Floyd's Algorithm of the Recursive Code against Floyd's Algorithm of the Imperative code (Imperative.py).

### Technologies

A list of technologies used within the project:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Version 3.11.0 
* [visualstudio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/):Version: 1.73.v 


### Software
To run this project, it is recommended that the tools specified in section 2 be installed, as well as the modules numpy, itertools, sys, timeit and unittest.

### Project
This project consists of 4 different modules.

1. RecursiveCode.py -- This module solves Floyd's algorithm recursively using nested loops.
2. Imperative.py el --- This module solves Floyd's algorithm using the itertools tool.
3. UnitTest.py --- This module validates the results of the recursive model against the optimal solution.
4. Performance.py --- This module compares the performance of the recursive vs. imperative model.

### Credits
The recursive model is an adaptation of the code of following web page. https://favtutor.com/blogs/floyd-warshall-algorithm
The imperative model that was used was a collaboration of Dr Brett Dury of the University of Liverpool.
